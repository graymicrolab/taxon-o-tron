# taxon-o-tron
A tool for determining species-level taxonomic distribution of proteins (Sept. 16, 2022)

The taxon-o-tron is a tool for determining the taxonomic distribution of protein homologs within a given clade of organisms. It is intended for use in concert with BLASTer.py, and generates taxonomic trees rather than alignments.

Based heavily on code in script BLASTer.py version 4.2. Developed on a Mac with OSX 10.15.7.

Dependencies: Python 3.10.7, Biopython 1.79, and treemaker 1.4

Finally, while I certainly hope this is useful for you, and I would love to hear from anyone about how they use this code, I am not a professional software developer and cannot commit to tech support or regular updates. This means the taxon-o-tron may well break as the underlying modules are updated and revised.

That being said, please feel free to contact me at mjgray@uab.edu
